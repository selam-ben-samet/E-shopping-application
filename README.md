We worked in pairs for that application. On the database side, we keep names,prices,images,bill informations,shipping companies,paying ways etc.
In application you can search for an item, you can sign up,sign in,put your item on sale or buy an item or so.

More explanation is available below.

You can choose a category to look at items here. But this is just better design for categories so you also can click the category you want in the left. The categories are Erkek(Man), Kadın(Woman), Elektronik(Electronics), Kırtasiye(stationary),Ev(Household).

Here you can sign in or sign up. You need your name,phone number,e-mail and password to sign up. Then you can sign in by your e-mail and password. When you signed in you can put an item on sale.

Here is your account page, you can change your informations except you phone number because other informations are getting found by your phone number. (This is very bad method to do it but this project is for homework and we are just beginners so we did it that way). When you are putting an item on sale you need the category of the item you are putting on sale, name, price, color, size and an image. For image you need to click the picture and choose an .jpg image from your computer. 

### Searching

You also can search but it is very simple searching. You need to type exactly the name of the item and it only shows one item.


Note : You can get the database files and import them so you can really use the application or see how it works.
